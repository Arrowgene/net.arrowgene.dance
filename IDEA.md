# IDEA

This document is to keep track of ideas.

# Dance Launcher
- Java application / cross platform (osx / linux = wine / auto setup)
- proxy, game connects to launcher, launcher to server
- download song files on demand, display progress in chat
- other cool stuff

# Dance Client
Maybe we can build our own client. The idea has already been around or mentioned, but we never keept track of it or discussed it. 

It would be great if the client can adjust to the environment. That means, when connecting to a server, it should be able to identify the server and work accordingly. This might be by detecting minor & major version of server, or matching the server network protocoll to the appropriate client behaviour.

In addition it should be possible to run the client in multiple systems. Windows, Linux and OSX. Since the game is not very famous, if it would be accesable from different platforms that would be a huge bonus.

## Dance! Online Support
* Support Dance! Online Assets (datas.sac)
* Support Dance! Online Network Protocoll

It should be able to just drop in the client in the dance folder, and it will work as a repalcement for client.bin

## Super Dancer Online Support (SDOX / CHINA)
* Support Super Dancer Online Assets (might be different?)
* Support Super Dancer Online Network Protcoll

Same as Dance! Online Support, we should be able to drop our client and it will know how to work.

This might be considered as the last step, since SDOX/CHINA are GIGANTIC...

## Custom Support
* Support own Assets Pipeline
* Support own Network Protocoll
* New Features

Now here comes the fun, and creativity!

We can think of ways how to improove the client above its default behaviour. That means for example implement our own asset pipeline, that is more developer friendly. (If we can build the tools to support the current asset pipeline without hassel, this might not be needed at all)

We can think of an own Network Protocol, that might be more effective or other means of transportation.

And finally, any awesome features that might be possible now.
- The Channel could be a 3D-World where you hang out before joining
- Guild Channel, wehre you can build/modify your 3d-World
- etc (add awesome idea here)
